This dashboard was developed to achieve the following goals:
* **Analyze Overall Performance:** Measure aggregate performance in terms of the number of imported vehicles and their total value.
* **Understand Customer Segments:** Identify and analyze the share of both individual and corporate clients to better understand the customer base.
* **Identify Key Products:** Recognize the most profitable and highest-volume brands (manufacturers) and models to guide purchasing and inventory decisions.
* **Monitor Market Trends:** Analyze changes in average vehicle prices and preferred types over the years to discover patterns and future trends.
* **Assess Market Share:** Determine the dominant players in the agency's portfolio and measure the degree of reliance on them.
* **Provide a Basis for Decisions:** Equip management with data-driven insights to formulate marketing, pricing, and sales strategies.

## ðŸ“Š Detailed Dashboard Analysis

### **Page 1: Executive Summary**
![Executive Summary](https://github.com/Abdulrahman-hussen/Imported-Vehicles-Data-Analysis-for-Rifai-Agency-2005-2025-/blob/main/screenshots/page1.png)


**1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
* **Total Number of Vehicles:** **1,973** vehicles were imported during the period.
* **Sales Value (Companies):** $52.36 \text{ Million}$.
* **Sales Value (Individuals):** $52.05 \text{ Million}$.
    * **Analysis:** The total sales value is distributed almost perfectly evenly between companies and individuals. This indicates two equally important and balanced markets that require distinct marketing and service strategies.

**2. Number of Vehicles by Year:**
* **Insight:** The chart shows limited imports in most years but reveals an **exceptional spike in 2020** with **634** vehicles imported.
    * **Analysis:** This massive jump does not represent organic growth but points to a unique event like a large fleet deal, a major project, or a change in import policy. The cause of this event should be investigated to understand its implications and potentially replicate its success.

**3. Manufacturers and Models (Highest & Lowest Profitability):**
* **Most Profitable:** **Hyundai** ($46M$), **Kia** ($15M$), and **Toyota** ($7M$). Models like **Avante** and **Santa Fe** top the list with a value of $8M$ each.
* **Least Profitable:** **Maserati** ($13.5K$) and **CR-V** ($5K$).
    * **Analysis:** The high profitability of Hyundai, Kia, and Toyota confirms they are the agency's core brands. The low profitability of some luxury or niche brands suggests they may be marginal products or imported in very limited quantities based on special requests.

This page allows analysts and managers to dive deep into the data and explore it using various filters.

**1. Aggregate Indicators:**
* **Total Value:** $104.4 \text{ Million}$. This is the total value of all imported vehicles.
* **Average Vehicle Price :** $52.9K$. This is a crucial indicator for understanding the purchasing power of the corporate sector.

**2. Manufacturer Dominance Ratio:**
* **Insight:** **Hyundai** absolutely dominates the agency's portfolio with a market share of **$43.81\%$**. It is followed by a distant **Kia** at $14.67\%$.
    * **Analysis:** This dominance makes Hyundai the cornerstone of the agency's business. While this is a position of strength, it also carries the risk of dependency on a single manufacturer. It would be strategically wise to strengthen relationships with other manufacturers like Kia and Toyota to diversify revenue streams.

**3. Most Imported Vehicle Types:**
* **Insight:** **SUVs** are the most popular category by a wide margin (748 vehicles), followed by **Sedans** (539 vehicles).
    * **Analysis:** This data leaves no room for doubt: **the primary demand is centered on the SUV category**. This reality should be directly reflected in inventory strategies, marketing campaigns, and sales offers.

**4. Average Vehicle Prices Over the Years:**
* **Insight:** The chart shows price volatility, peaking in 2014 ($73K$) and dipping in 2018 ($35K$), with a new upward trend towards 2025.
    * **Analysis:** These fluctuations may reflect changes in the mix of imported cars (luxury vs. economy), global economic conditions, or currency exchange rate volatility. The recent upward trend could indicate a shift towards importing higher-value vehicles.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Conclusions and Recommendations

Based on the comprehensive analysis, the following conclusions and recommendations can be drawn:

1.  **Strategic Focus on Hyundai:** Hyundai is the main driver of profit and market share. The partnership with Hyundai should be strengthened while seeking opportunities to mitigate risk by promoting other strong brands like Kia.
2.  **Dominance of the SUV Category:** SUVs must be the top priority in procurement and marketing plans, as they represent the largest segment of demand.
3.  **Understand the Dual Market Depth:** With a 50/50 split between individuals and companies, tailored campaigns and sales offers should be designed for each segment to meet their different needs.
4.  **Analyze the 2020 Anomaly:** A deep-dive investigation into the reasons for the 2020 spike is necessary. If it resulted from a successful deal, the feasibility of replicating that model should be studied.
5.  **Monitor Pricing Dynamics:** The upward trend in vehicle prices requires a continuous review of pricing strategies to maintain competitiveness and profit margins.
